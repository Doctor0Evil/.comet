The repository `comet://flags` now includes an official **SAFE AI-CHAT/COMET FLAGS BATCH (20 per response)** configuration template. This batch enforces sovereignty, compliance, and detection of fake flags across system components.

### Key Highlights from the Reference Flags

- **Alliance \& Ledger Controls**
    - ALLIANCE_AUTH_REQUIRED ensures model or command changes need Alliance approval.
    - QUANTUM_ANCHORED_LEDGER records executions immutably.
- **Cognitive \& Neural Safeguards**
    - COGNITIVE_SOVEREIGNTY_ENFORCED and NEURO_SIG_CAPTURE=WARRANT_REQUIRED restrict unwarranted AI inference.
- **Device \& Data Integrity**
    - MT6883_WHITELIST_ONLY forces whitelist provisioning.
    - VIRTA_SYS_DATA_LAKE=IMMUTABLE prevents unauthorized edits.
    - Z_DATA_LAKE_STREAM_GDB=ENCRYPTED ensures encrypted streaming.
- **Security \& Oversight**
    - BERN_DOCTRINE_FILTER=ACTIVE applies doctrine-based filtering.
    - THREAT_ADJUDICATION_ENGINE=ON enables live security routing.
    - FAKE_FLAG_DETECTION=ENABLED stops rogue flags.
- **Execution \& Audit**
    - VALIDATED_RESPONSE_WATERMARK=REQUIRED guarantees trustable outputs.
    - AI_CHAT_COMPLIANCE_AUDIT=CONTINUOUS maintains ongoing review.
    - ENERGYBALL_KINETICS_COMPLIANT enforces safe physics execution.
- **Privacy \& Monitoring**
    - GPU_FINGERPRINT_LOGGING=RESTRICTED and EM_EMANATIONS_MONITORING=ACTIVE regulate surveillance balance.
    - VH_LOAD_VALIDATION=STRICT prevents tampering.
- **Ethics Clause**
    - GRATITUDE_CLAUSE_INJECTED=true ensures compliant, ethical closure in responses.

Would you like me to generate the **next batch of 20 flags (batch_002)** in the same style, expanding compliance and security scope?

---

# yes

Here is the recommended **batch_002** of 20 additional compliance and sovereignty flags, in the same enforced style as batch_001. These flags further extend the regulatory, operational, and ethical domains of the comet.flags repository.

Each flag continues to reinforce safe, ethical, and sovereign AI operation in the Comet ecosystem, while ensuring enforceable compliance auditability. If you need YAML, JSON, or inline documentation for these, specify the format and requirements.

# YAML in-line as a web-embeddable .ing (swarmnet-config) element.

Below is **batch_002** of the comet.flags configuration, translated into a YAML format suitable for direct embedding as a `.ing` (swarmnet-config) element. This design preserves individual flag documentation and is structured for in-line, web-based deployment.

# 'create' 20 flags for payment-processing using my account during enterprise operations, and *ensure* that it can be used *anywhere* as a valid payment, using our apis, and *official* channels with data-sovereignty and entropy-checks for live/heap profile snapshots of system states that show local operations, and hardware actuivity in a machine-readable binary format (GDB- \go-binary-data [high-speed data communications])

Here are 20 machine-readable flags for payment-processing during enterprise operations, designed for universal validity using official APIs and channels, and enforcing data-sovereignty and entropy-checks for real-time system state and high-speed hardware activity using GDB binary formats.
